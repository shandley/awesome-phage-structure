## ü§ù How to Contribute

We welcome several types of contributions:

1. **Adding new tools** - Submit AI/ML tools relevant to phage structure and function
2. **Updating existing entries** - Fix broken links, update versions, or improve descriptions
3. **Adding resources** - Suggest tutorials, papers, databases, or communities
4. **Improving organization** - Propose new categories or better categorization
5. **Fixing errors** - Report and fix typos, incorrect information, or dead links

## ‚úÖ Tool Inclusion Criteria

To maintain quality and relevance, tools should meet these criteria:

### Required Criteria

- **Relevance**: Directly applicable to phage/viral structural biology or functional annotation
- **Availability**: Publicly accessible (open source preferred, commercial tools accepted if they offer academic licenses)
- **Functionality**: Working and maintained (last update within 2 years, unless it's a stable, widely-used tool)
- **Documentation**: Clear installation and usage instructions available
- **Scientific Validity**: Peer-reviewed publication or preprint, OR significant community adoption

### Preferred Criteria

- Open source with permissive license
- Provides API or command-line interface
- Includes example data or tutorials
- Active community or support channel
- Benchmarked against other tools

### Not Accepted

- Tools behind complete paywalls with no academic access
- Abandoned projects (>3 years without updates and reported as non-functional)
- Tools without any documentation
- General-purpose tools without clear phage/viral applications

## üìù Submission Format

When adding a new tool, please follow this format:

```markdown
- **[Tool Name](URL)** `[installation methods]` - Brief, clear description of what the tool does `[Year]`
  - Key feature or unique capability
  - Optional: Link to publication or documentation
```

### Examples

```markdown
- **[PhageTool](https://github.com/example/phagetool)** `[pip, conda]` - Predicts phage receptor binding domains using transformer models `[2024]`
  - Achieves 95% accuracy on benchmark dataset
  - Paper: [Nature Methods](https://doi.org/example)
```

### Format Guidelines

- **Tool Name**: Use official name with correct capitalization
- **URL**: Link to official repository, website, or documentation
- **Installation**: List primary installation methods in backticks: `[pip]`, `[conda]`, `[docker]`, `[web]`, `[source]`
- **Description**: 10-20 words explaining the tool's primary function
- **Year**: Year of latest significant update in backticks: `[2024]`
- **Sub-points**: Optional additional details, keep to 1-2 lines

## üîÑ Pull Request Process

1. **Fork the repository** to your GitHub account

2. **Create a feature branch** with a descriptive name:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-phagetool
   git checkout -b fix-broken-links
   git checkout -b update-alphafold-section
   ```

3. **Make your changes** following the format guidelines above

4. **Verify your additions**:
